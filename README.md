PROJECT OVERVIEW

This project is a real-time drone telemetry dashboard that simulates flight data for a mission duration of 60 seconds. The system visualizes key parameters such as:

Altitude (0–500 meters)

Speed (0–20 m/s)

Battery Percentage (100% decreasing over time)

GPS Coordinates (Latitude/Longitude)

System Alerts and Mission Status

Live altitude trend graph

The simulation generates realistic behavior using time-based calculations and controlled random variations to mimic actual drone flight conditions.

TECHNOLOGY CHOICE

This project is implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are my core strengths in web development. The web-based approach provides:

Interactive real-time telemetry visualization

Professional mission-control style dashboard

Cross-platform compatibility (runs in any browser)

Lightweight and dependency-free deployment

Easy integration with future APIs or backend systems

FILES INCLUDED

dashboard.html – Interactive real-time telemetry dashboard

README.md / README.txt – Project documentation

ONE_PAGE_EXPLANATION.txt – Project summary

HOW TO RUN

Open dashboard.html in any modern web browser

Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge recommended

No server required – runs entirely in the browser

No installation or dependencies needed

The simulation starts automatically on page load

The dashboard updates every second for the full mission duration

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

Technical Stack:

HTML5 – Structure and semantic layout

CSS3 – Dark aerospace theme, responsive design

JavaScript (ES6) – Real-time simulation logic

Chart.js – Live altitude visualization

CSS Grid & Flexbox – Layout management

Features:

Real-time telemetry updates (1-second interval)

Mission timer and system status indicator

Dynamic progress bars for altitude, speed, and battery

Live altitude trend graph

GPS coordinate drift simulation

Automated system alerts (Low battery, High altitude, Overspeed)

Connection status indicator

Professional aerospace-style UI

Lightweight single-page application

How it Works:

JavaScript generates telemetry data every second

Altitude varies dynamically within operational limits

Speed fluctuates with realistic random behavior

Battery decreases gradually over time

GPS coordinates shift slightly to simulate movement

Threshold-based alerts trigger warning messages

Chart updates continuously to display altitude trends
