PROJECT OVERVIEW
This project is a web-based Drone Telemetry Simulator that visualizes real-time flight data for a simulated mission. The system displays key operational parameters such as:

Altitude (0–500 meters)

Speed (0–20 m/s)

Battery level

GPS coordinates

System alerts and mission status

Real-time altitude trend graph

The dashboard updates every second, generating realistic flight behavior and presenting the information through a professional aerospace-style interface.

TECHNOLOGY STACK
Frontend

HTML5 – Structure and layout

CSS3 – Styling, responsive design, dark aerospace theme

JavaScript (ES6) – Simulation logic and real-time updates

Chart.js – Live altitude visualization

Key Characteristics

Runs entirely in the browser

No installation required

No backend or external setup needed

FEATURES
Real-time telemetry simulation (1-second update interval)

Mission timer and status indicator

Dynamic progress bars for:

Altitude

Speed

Battery

Live altitude trend chart

GPS coordinate simulation with realistic drift

Automated alert system:

Low battery warning

High altitude warning

Overspeed detection

Connection status indicator

Responsive dashboard layout

Lightweight single-page application

SIMULATION LOGIC
The telemetry values are generated using mathematical and time-based models:

Altitude: Random variation within operational range

Speed: Controlled random behavior within flight limits

Battery: Gradual discharge over mission duration

GPS: Small coordinate drift to simulate movement

Alerts: Triggered when operational thresholds are exceeded

Mission duration: 60 seconds
Update frequency: 1 second

HOW TO RUN
Download or clone the repository

Open the file:

dashboard.html
Open it in any modern browser:

Chrome

Firefox

Edge

Safari

The simulation starts automatically on page load.
