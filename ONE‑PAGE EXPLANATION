ONE‑PAGE EXPLANATION
Major Aerospace CSWE Internship Task – Drone Telemetry Dashboard

WHAT I BUILT
I developed an interactive web‑based Drone Telemetry Dashboard that simulates real‑time flight data for a mission duration of 60 seconds. The system displays key flight parameters such as Altitude, Speed, Battery Level, and GPS Location, updating every second to reflect realistic drone behavior.

The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging my web development skills to create a responsive and professional monitoring interface similar to real-world aerospace control dashboards.

HOW IT WORKS
The simulator generates realistic drone flight patterns using mathematical models and time‑based calculations:

Altitude: Varies dynamically within a 0–500 meter range to simulate ascent and descent behavior

Speed: Changes between 0–20 m/s with controlled random variation

Battery: Gradually decreases over the mission duration

GPS Coordinates: Slight positional drift each second to simulate movement

System Monitoring: Generates alerts for low battery, high altitude, or overspeed conditions

The system updates at 1‑second intervals, ensuring smooth and continuous telemetry visualization.

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION
Technologies Used

HTML5 – Semantic structure

CSS3 – Dark aerospace theme, grid layout, responsive design

WHY WEB TECHNOLOGY?
I chose web technologies because:

They align with my core skills in front‑end development

Modern telemetry and monitoring systems often use web dashboards

Web applications provide cross‑platform accessibility

They allow rapid development, visualization, and integration with future APIs or backend systems

This project demonstrates my ability to apply practical web development skills to solve real-world monitoring and visualization problems.
